# Half-Traveling-Salesman-Problem
PROJECT NAME
HALF TRAVELÄ°NG SALESMAN PROBLEM

ABOUT THE PROJECT
The aim of the project is to ensure that the seller travels half of the cities by the shortest route and comes to the city where he is at first. We used the java language for this. Using the Nearest neighbor algorithm, we make a search from both the beginning and the end, find the shortest path and draw a route accordingly. Finally, we return to the place where we started and determine our path. We write the distance of the shortest road on the screen and which route we use for this distance.
